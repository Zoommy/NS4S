# NS4S

This is the repository to the corresponding paper "NS4S: Neighborhood Search for Scheduling Problems Via Large Language Models". 

This folder contains benchmark instances, optimal or high-quality solutions, and Gantt chart visualizations for the NS4S scheduling problems. These resources facilitate research and reproducibility for scheduling algorithm performance evaluation.

## Directory Structure

- `Benchmark/`: Benchmark instance files for NS4S, including various oddla series scheduling problem descriptions.
- `Solutions/`: Optimal or high-quality scheduling solutions (`_Oij.txt`) for selected benchmark instances, useful for algorithm performance comparison.
- `GanttCharts/`: Gantt chart visualizations (PNG images) corresponding to the solutions, providing an intuitive analysis of scheduling results.

## Notes

- The `.txt` files in the Benchmark folder are the original scheduling problem data.
- The `.txt` files in the Solutions folder are the scheduling solution results for each instance.
- The `.png` files in the GanttCharts folder are Gantt chart visualizations of the scheduling solutions.
